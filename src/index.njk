<h1>Next meetup</h1>
  
<p>LeicesterJS is back for another tech (and pizza) filled evening. Connect with local developers and listen to talks by industry leaders and experts.</p>

<p>Remember we're in a brand new location at the offices of DeadHappy this month! See below for the address.</p>

<p>This month we have a talk being given by James Seconde who is a developer Advocate, speaker, writer, co-host of Fusion meetup, founder of BrumPHP, Developer Relations strategist and software engineer.<br />He'll be coming to talk to us about "The Politics of Tool Shaming".<br />Here is a sneak preview of what you can expect from this talk:</p>

<p>"A story of the industry, on why gatekeeping and elitism is bad for your personal development, your business and the tech industry. It's a problem, and I'm going to propose a solution."</p>

<p>But wait! There is more! LeicesterJS Stickers will be up for grabs! Come down and get yourself one!</p>

<p>The scheduled start is 7 pm, with food and refreshments at 7:30 pm, followed by networking and general discussion with a scheduled end time of around 8:30 pm.</p>
