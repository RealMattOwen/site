<h2>Details</h2>

<p>LeicesterJS is back for another tech filled evening. Connect with local developers and listen to talks by industry leaders and experts.</p>

<p>This month we have a talk being given by Tom Geraghty who is a "veteran technology team builder" according to Computing Magazine, Tom is an expert in transforming team performance. Over his 15 years as a technology leader, he has come to believe that culture trumps strategy, and happiness precedes success.</p>

<p>Tom is currently the Head of Technology at MoreNiche in Nottingham, CTO of Ydentity, an identity protection startup, and a management consultant for Q5.</p>

<p>Outside of work, Tom is a yoga teacher and mountain biker.</p>

<p>He'll be coming to talk to us about "Missile Destroyers, Supercomputers, and Chernobyl. Psychological safety in high performance teams".<br />Here is a sneak preview of what you can expect from this talk:</p>

<p>"Safety isn't just necessary in order to prevent disasters, it's also crucial to building and maintaining high performance teams and organisations.</p>

<p>Building high performing software requires high performing teams, in which team members need to feel able to express their creativity, talents and skills without self-censoring, self-silencing, or fear of failure. In this talk, Tom introduces the latest research in high performance technology teams, and provides actionable concepts to help you build and elevate your team."</p>

<p>Out second talk will be by Jessica Whitelock, who before entering the world of tech had more than 6 years education experience and a masters in Learning, Education and Technology. Now working as a director of the software company STaC Solutions she is uniquely placed to understand the complexities of coding and how to best introduce these to young children.</p>

<p>Jessica will be giving a talk entitled "If I were five, how would I solve this problem?"<br />Here's a quick preview: "In a technological landscape very different to that we experienced when we were at school, how are programming concepts introduced to young children? A fun and interactive workshop showing how to get children thinking computationally presented as part of a wider series on how to use computing in home-school activities."</p>

<p>We'll be posting more information shortly. If you'd like to give a remote talk, please let us know in our slack or via email (details below!)</p>
