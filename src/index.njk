<h1>Next meetup</h1>

<p>
  This month, we've got Edd Wilson from Impression Digital about SEO and the Javascript Landscape. 
  The rise in Javascript and Google's rendering capability has lead to Javascript frameworks failing in search. 
  Edd will run through how Googlebot works, what websites heavily utilising JS can do and the clients that he's helped.

  SEO is something we often don't like to think about as developers but is critical for clients. 
  This is one you won't want to miss!
