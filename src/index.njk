<h1>July Meetup</h1>

<p><strong>Heads up! This event will be presented remotely.</strong></p>

<p>This month we have a talk by Mark Goodwin. Mark is a software security specialist with decades of experience in building and securing Internet facing systems. Mark has worked on a number of high profile projects including major financial systems and Mozilla's Firefox web browser. Mark is currently responsible for Security Research at Hardenize.</p>

<p>He's talking to us about "Browser Hacking for JavaScript Programmers". Here is a quick preview of the talk:</p>

<blockquote>Did you think "full stack web developer" meant you could only work on web applications? Think again! This talk introduces you to the idea of using your JavaScript skills to improve the user agent; in WebExtensions and even the browser itself.</blockquote>

<p>We can't wait to hear this talk and see you all. Please RSVP and you'll get the Zoom link :)</p>
