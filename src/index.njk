<h1>Next meetup</h1>
  
<p>LeicesterJS is back for another tech (and pizza) filled evening. Connect with local developers and listen to talks by industry leaders and experts.</p>

<p>This month we have a talk being given by Tom Geraghty who is a "veteran technology team builder" according to Computing Magazine, Tom is an expert in transforming team performance. Over his 15 years as a technology leader, he has come to believe that culture trumps strategy, and happiness precedes success.</p>

<p>Tom is currently the Head of Technology at MoreNiche in Nottingham, CTO of Ydentity, an identity protection startup, and a management consultant for Q5.</p>

<p>Outside of work, Tom is a yoga teacher and mountain biker.</p>

<p>He'll be coming to talk to us about "Missile Destroyers, Supercomputers, and Chernobyl. Psychological safety in high performance teams".<br />Here is a sneak preview of what you can expect from this talk:</p>

<p>"Safety isn't just necessary in order to prevent disasters, it's also crucial to building and maintaining high performance teams and organisations.</p>

<p>Building high performing software requires high performing teams, in which team members need to feel able to express their creativity, talents and skills without self-censoring, self-silencing, or fear of failure. In this talk, Tom introduces the latest research in high performance technology teams, and provides actionable concepts to help you build and elevate your team."</p>

<p>But wait! There is more! LeicesterJS Stickers will be up for grabs! Come down and get yourself one!</p>

<p>The scheduled start is 7 pm, with food and refreshments at 7:30 pm, followed by networking and general discussion with a scheduled end time of around 8:30 pm.</p>
