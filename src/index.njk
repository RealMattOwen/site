<h1>Next meetup</h1>
  
 <p>
 This month we have a talk entitled "JS in CSS: The magic of Houdini" by Laura Gonzalez. Laura is a software developer at Facebook (and before that, Guardian & The Next Web). 
 She loves all things JavaScript and CSS and in her free time, she can be seen doing pointless NPM modules or feeding squirrels at the park.
