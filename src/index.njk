<h1>Next meetup</h1>
<p>This month we have a talk entitled "JS in CSS: The magic of Houdini" by Laura Gonzalez. Laura is a software developer at Facebook (and before that, Guardian & The Next Web). She loves all things Javascript and CSS and in her free time, she can be seen doing pointless NPM modules or feeding squirrels at the park.</p>
<p>
  This is one you won't want to miss!
