<h1>March Meetup Cancelled</h1>

<p>It is with a heavy heart that we announce the LeicesterJS March meetup has been cancelled.</p>
<p>In light of the current government response, the team here has been monitoring the situation closely and we've agreed that the risk presented by the COVID-19 Coronavirus is too serious to ignore.</p>
<p>There are many complex considerations to ensuring everyone's safety, and we think that cancelling the meetup is the best option for everyone.</p>
<p>If you were as excited as us about this meetup, sorry! We hope you'll stay tuned for our next announcement.</p>
<p>If you have any questions or queries feel free to direct them at our <a href="https://twitter.com/leicesterjs">Twitter</a>, in our <a href="https://www.leicesterjs.org/slack">Slack</a> or via <a href="https://www.meetup.com/leicesterjs">Meetup</a>.</p>
