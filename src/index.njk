<h1>Next meetup</h1>
  
<p>The Earth has yet again successfully completed an orbit around the sun, and thankfully LeicesterJS is still here and back for 2020! We can't wait for all the great talks we have lined up and are eager to meet you all.</p>

<p>This month we have a talk entitled "Knowing Your Worth: Don’t Set Yourself On Fire To Keep Others Warm" by Alex Lofthouse of JH.</p>

<p>Here is a quick preview of what you can expect in the talk:<br />Am I doing enough? Am I even doing it right? How can I do it better? What the hell is Imposter Syndrome and why do I have it? What’s a Work/Life Balance? Huh, now I’m having a breakdown&hellip;</p>

<p>After putting her career first for the best part of a decade and then having a minor breakdown, Lex was compelled to make herself a number one priority.</p>

<p>In her talk, Lex will discuss Imposter Syndrome and how she learned to fail correctly. Discussing negative feedback and how to deal with it, toxic environments, burnout, and crunch. Plus we’ll finally figure out that work/life balance thing once and for all.</p>
