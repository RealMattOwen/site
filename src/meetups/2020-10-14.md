Heads up! This is a remote meetup taking place over Zoom - Please RSVP for the URL.

This month we'll be diving into Hacktoberfest! See more details here: https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/

Here is a preview of agenda (roughly)

* `6:45pm` - Intro + intro to some open source repos from leicesterjs members and how to find others
* `7pm` - invite others to share repos they've found to contribute to, success stories and demos of repos they'd like to propose
* `7:20pm` - Hacking time
* `7:50pm` - Work done! Show and tell
* `8pm` - Goodbyes

We hope to see you there and have fun with contributing to open source projects.
